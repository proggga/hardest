# hardest
Hardest - hardcore test tool for style your code, check complexity and coverage

This tool creates configs for testing your project in hardest way.

We use:
* pytest - the test runner
* pylint - hardcore linter (google use it)
* flake8 (hacking) - linter from openstack
* coverage - test coverage of tests (only pass when 100% covered)
* xenon (radon) - cyclomatic complexity
* mypy - optional static type checker for Python
* tox - for test all this in different environments
